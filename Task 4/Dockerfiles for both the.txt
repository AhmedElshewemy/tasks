 Dockerfiles for both the Laravel application and the MySQL server.

MySQL Dockerfile uses the official MySQL image and sets up environment variables.
but i can specify everything in the docker-compose.yml file without needing separate Dockerfile files for each service. 

Developed the Docker Compose configuration (docker-compose.yml).
Configured environment variables, volumes, and networks for service communication.

Defined services for PHP-FPM, MySQL, and Nginx.


Built and launched the containers using Docker Compose.

Commands used:

docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
